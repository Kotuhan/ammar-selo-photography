      <p>My name is Ammar Selo.
        I have a mechanical engineering degree and have spent
        10 years in the Oil & Gas industry. I discovered my passion for photography
        a few years back so I left the corporate life to pursue my passion full time.
        My training as an engineer has helped me bring methodical discipline to the art of photography.
        I am happily married with three beautiful children. In addition to photography, I provide album design
        and print services along with other high quality printing options such as Canvas, Aluminum, and framed photo prints.
        For all inquiries, please shoot me a message or call me at my cell and I will return back to you within 24hrs.
